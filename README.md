# Memoirs

*Memoirs* is a "memory recording” application targeted to elderly care home residents to take photographs of treasured possessions and associate them with a varying number oral descriptions of their significance.

The aim is to improve the social lives of elderly citizens by helping the aged to form a stronger connection with care home staff, family and friends through giving a deeper insight into their past.

The project is part of the [Software Product Engeneering (COMS20805)](https://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/Teaching/Resources/COMS20805/) unit from the second year of the Computer Science course at the [University of Bristol](http://www.bris.ac.uk/).
